 Hi, I’m @Hamzah023, an Honours Co-op Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, with a minor in Project Management.

I build software for startups in Toronto. I enjoy connecting with angel investors, builders, and founders.
  
I have two years of work experience in engineering production-level systems at various startups and F500 companies around the world.

⚡ Fun fact: The Social Network is my favourite movie. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this sentence.
