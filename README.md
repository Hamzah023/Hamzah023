👋 Hi, I’m @Hamzah023, an honours Co-op Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, minoring in Project Management.

👀 I build software for startups in Toronto. I like to connect with angel investors, builders and founders.
  
🌱 My stack is ASP.NET Core, Springboot, C, Node.js, Express.js, Typescript, React, Flask, Selenium, Puppeteer, BeautifulSoup, Pandas, Numpy, Google Cloud/Firebase and PostgreSQL.

💞️ I have two years of work experience in Health Tech, FinTech, Steel, and AI startups.

⚡ Fun fact: The Social Network is my favourite movie. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this sentence.
