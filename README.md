 Hi, I’m @Hamzah023, an honours Co-op Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, minoring in Project Management.

I build software for startups in Toronto. I like to connect with angel investors, builders and founders.
  
I have two years of work experience in various companies and startups.

⚡ Fun fact: The Social Network is my favourite movie. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this sentence.
