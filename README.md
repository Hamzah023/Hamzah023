👋 Hi, I’m @Hamzah023, I am an honours Co-op Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, minoring in Project Management.

👀 I am currently working on a few startups in Toronto. I am trying to connect with venture capitalists, angel investors, and anyone interested in our projects. So if that sounds like you, feel free to connect with me and send me a message!
  
🌱 I’m currently learning asp.net core, flask, springboot, selenium, react, and beautifulsoup, and implementing them on my projects such as FileHandler, and CourseCalendarAutomator

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startups, I have two years of work experience in early-stage pre-seed startups, and I love the community.

📫 Reach out to me on LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/hamzahimrann/ if you have any tips or comments about my work.

⚡ Fun fact: My favourite movie is The Social Network, I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this sentence.
