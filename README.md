👋 Hi, I’m @Hamzah023, I am an honours Co-op Computer Science student at the University of Guelph, minoring in Project Management.

👀 I am currently working on a few startups in Toronto. I am trying to connect with venture capitalists, angel investors, and anyone interested in our projects. So if that sounds like you, feel free to connect with me and send me a message!
  
🌱 My stack is ASP.NET Core, Flask, Spring Boot, Selenium, React, Beautiful Soup, Pandas, Numpy, Node.js, Express.js and SQL.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on startups, I have two years of work experience in startups in HealthTech, FinTech, SteelTech etc. and love the community.
