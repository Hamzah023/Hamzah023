 Hi, I’m Hamzah, I build software for startups in Toronto. I enjoy connecting with angel investors, builders, and founders.
  
I have two years of work experience in engineering production-level systems at various startups and F500 companies around the world. If you want to see more of my work, please check out my portfolio.

⚡ Fun fact: The Social Network is my favourite movie. I'm actually listening to the soundtrack while writing this sentence.
